title: "TASEP Speed Process: An Effective Medium Approach"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019tasep
excerpt: 'Advantage begets further advantage - this effect, often called the Matthew effect, is observed in various forms in day-to-day life, most commonly in social and economic aspects. But can such an effect be seen in systems where the evolution is completely memory-less? In this work, we study the TASEP Speed Process, in which the dynamics of a special particle at late times is heavily determined by its dynamics at early times. We provide a simple description of this phenomenon using an effective medium approximation and demonstrate its applicability in other relevant settings. A simple presentation of our key findings is given in [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339440235_TASEP_Speed_Process_An_Effective_Medium_Approach) poster which was presented at the Indian Statistical Physics Community Meeting 2020, held at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore.'

Advantage begets further advantage - this effect, often called the Matthew effect, is observed in various forms in day-to-day life, most commonly in social and economic aspects. But can such an effect be seen in systems where the evolution is completely memory-less? In this work, we study the TASEP Speed Process, in which the dynamics of a special particle at late times is heavily determined by its dynamics at early times. We will provide a simple description of this phenomenon using an effective medium approximation and demonstrate its applicability in other relevant settings. A simple presentation of our key findings is given in [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339440235_TASEP_Speed_Process_An_Effective_Medium_Approach) poster which was presented at the Indian Statistical Physics Community Meeting 2020, held at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore.
