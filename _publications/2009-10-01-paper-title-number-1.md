excerpt: 'Extreme events often tend to be associated with natural disasters such as the floods, droughts and earthquakes. However, more generally, any event whose magnitude displays pronounced deviation from its typical average value can be regarded as an extreme event. This definition includes events ranging from traffic congestion to powerblack-outs. In particular, many of these extreme events take place on the topology of a network. Hence, it is of interest  to study how the network structure affects extreme event properties, and if these networks, as a whole unit, can survive the onslaught of extreme events taking place on them. Using the paradigm of random walks on complex networks, in this work, we perform a detailed analytical study of extreme events that occur on the edges of networks, which complements previous works on extreme events on nodes, while simultaneously providing several fresh insights.'

Extreme events often tend to be associated with natural disasters such as the floods, droughts and earthquakes. However, more generally, any event whose magnitude displays pronounced deviation from its typical average value can be regarded as an extreme event. This definition includes events ranging from traffic congestion to powerblack-outs. In particular, many of these extreme events take place on the topology of a network. Hence, it is of interest  to study how the network structure affects extreme event properties, and if these networks, as a whole unit, can survive the onslaught of extreme events taking place on them. Earlier, extreme  events  on the nodes of a complex network had been studied using the paradigm of random walks on complex networks. Surprisingly, it was found that extreme event occurrence probability was lower for the hubs when compared to the small degree nodes of the network. In this work, we show that the extreme event probability on the edges is a constant,  and is dependent only on the parameters such as the total number of edges and the number of walkers. Furthermore, the correlation between the extreme events on the edges and nodes that they link have been studied. The  non-trivial correlations indicate the role played by network structure even though the dynamics itself is that of random walkers with no memory effects.
