How fast can a group of drunkards starting from one node of a scale-free network explore the rest of the network? We look to answer this question in our work. A simple presentation of our key findings is given in [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329268902_Reachability_on_scale-free_networks) poster which was presented in the WE-Heraeus Seminar "Search and Problem Solving by Random Walks: Drunkards Vs. Quantum Computers" which took place in the Physikzentrum at Bad Honnef near Bonn (Germany) from May 28 to June 1, 2018.
