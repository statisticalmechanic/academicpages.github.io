My name is Aanjaneya Kumar and I am a PhD student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) working under the supervision of [Prof. M. S Santhanam](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/). My primary interest is in obtaining insight into practically relevant problems, which could arise in various fields including (but not restricted to) physics, biology, and the social sciences, by first formulating them as mathematical models and then analyzing them using tools from Statistical Physics, Graph Theory and Game Theory.  

A unifying theme of my interests comes from the guiding philosophy behind the several recent developments in the field of Nonequilibrium Statistical Physics. Statistical Physics is a branch of science that deals with systems comprising of a large number of units where we attempt to better understand the phenomena that emerge out of their interactions - many of which are not accessible through reductionist treatments. Systems that are in equilbrium obey the laws of Equilibrium Statistical Physics âˆ’ a subject whose tools are mature and well developed. However, unlike its equilibrium counterpart, Nonequilibrium Statistical Physics does not have an overarching formalism. But in the last three decades, this field has seen a substantial amount of progress. A significant portion of this recent progress has come through the adoption of a *kinetic* approach. The idea of this approach is to study simple stochastic models specified by dynamical rules which capture the essence of the real process that we are trying to describe. Once the model and its dynamical rules are established, the next step is to critically analyze these simple models, and through this analysis, uncover the new features that the model could possibly tell us about the real process at hand.
