My name is Aanjaneya Kumar and I am a PhD student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) working under the supervision of [Prof. M. S Santhanam](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/). My primary interest is in obtaining insight into practically relevant problems, which could arise in various fields including (but not restricted to) physics, biology, and the social sciences, by first formulating them as mathematical models and then analyzing them using tools from Statistical Physics, Graph Theory and Game Theory. Here is a link to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NmDan2AIuPYDvGjsz_qBM_EWmpGll8Pb/view?usp=sharing).

As a Prime Minister's Research Fellow, I aim to carry out collaborative, interdisciplinary research in the following areas:


# Extreme Events

The study of extreme events and systemic failures is a theme that has received a lot of attention recently. While they are ubiquitous across domains -- from market crashes and blackouts, to collapse of bridges and internet breakdown -- extreme events can result in disastrous consequences for the systems they occur in and severely disrupt its functioning. To this end, a growing body of literature is focused towards building a theoretical framework to analyze such rare events. The classical extreme value statistics is nearly a century old and more recently, advances in large deviation theory have improved our understanding of extreme events. However, while the examples in which extreme events are usually brought up have a negative connotation to them, several extreme events in the form of rare binding events form the basis for many bio-chemical reactions essential for life. 

A major focus of my present research is to study extreme events in simple stochastic models that capture key features of practically relevant problems, and through my analysis, try to gain insight into the problem at hand. While the study of extreme events will form the bulk of my thesis (that's the plan), I keep my eyes open for new learning opportunities. Some other areas that seem fascinating to me are:  


# Interacting Algorithms

Human decision making is increasingly delegated to algorithms in a variety of contexts, ranging from high-frequency financial trading to online bot ecosystems in social media, to the so called “Internet of things”. Together with enormous potential for economic growth, such a paradigmatic change brings considerable uncertainty. Indeed, a number of situations have already exposed the unintended consequences that may emerge from systems of algorithms interacting in a largely unsupervised manner. A key interest for me in this project is to be able to build a formal understanding of the conditions under which the behaviour of such autonomous systems may result in large scale failures or, more generally, unintended and undesirable consequences. 


# Evolutionary Game Theory

Apart from helping us understand biodiveristy, the theory of evolution has given us insight into the evolution of cooperation and languages, as well as the dynamics of virus infections and human cancer. The simple underlying idea behind the theory is that different features among individuals (physical appearance, behaviours, strategies) lead to different (appropriately defined) fitnesses, which eventually leads to a higher relative representation of individuals, whose traits were deemed evolutionarily fit in the past, and hence those traits were successfully passed on to later generations. Concepts from game theory, which were introduced to study rational self-interested agents, have now been able to successfully give a mathematical structure to the theory of evolution, which allows us to probe several questions. A bunch of (related) questions that I am interested in are: Even with the advent of technology, while the facts maybe just a careful Google search away, why does fake news persist for long in our society? Why do retracted papers continue to be cited in scientific literature? Is there a way in which we could combat misinformation?
